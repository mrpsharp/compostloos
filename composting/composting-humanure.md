## Composting Humanure
***by John Cossham, aka ‘Compost John’: prepared for the Compost Toilets for Boats & Offgrid Living Facebook group***

Composting is essentially a very simple process, where we give the materials we want to decompose the best possible environment to do that in. We mostly compost ‘waste’ materials and the result is a useful soil amendment which provides nutrients for plants and is good for soil health and the many organisms which live there.

A compost bin, or pile, or wormery needs a mixture of materials, moisture and air, and time. The ‘workers’ are bacteria, fungi, and invertebrates such as worms, mites, insect larvae and woodlice. The sorts of materials that will decompose are from animals and plants. Avoid adding anything mineral-based like glass, metal, plastic or soil, or synthetic chemicals like paint or pesticides. Contrary to some sources, it is possible to compost meat and cooked food, animal or vegetable oils and fats, dairy items, pet manure and human faeces or manure, often shortened to ‘humanure’.

Humanure is largely water and has a high nitrogen to carbon ratio, and in composting terms can be considered a ‘green’ material. Urine, often collected with humanure, is a very high nitrogen material and is widely used as an activator for compost heaps. Ignore any sex- discrimination you hear about the origin of the urine – male and female urine is equal in value in composting.

Humanure is often collected via compost toilets or waterless toilets, and if it isn’t composted in situ, under the pedestal, then it will be removed in a bucket or other container and put somewhere for composting. The contents of the bucket will be the humanure, toilet paper, cover or soak material, and sometimes urine, which if added will require lots more soak material. The best cover/soak materials are carbon-rich and small particles, such as sawdust, wood shavings, rice hulls or hemp seed hulls, shredded paper or even chopped autumn leaves. If the material is dry, this will be great for absorbing moisture, but if the sawdust is pre- composted (left outside to be damp for a few months) then the growing microbes in the sawdust will make it a biofilter, reducing or eliminating any odours from the collection container. If the humanure has been collected from a dry toilet with a fan which draws off the moisture, meaning a cover/soak material isn’t needed, some carbon-rich materials will need to be added to the mix when it’s added to the compost bin.

As the water-rich manure is broken down rapidly by bacteria, lots of the water is released as vapour, and the volume of material shrinks significantly. After the initial bacterial decomposition, fungi and worms will move in, and the lignin in the woody cover will slowly be digested. Some compost bins will have crops of fungus fruiting bodies appear on their top surface. Pathogenic bacteria from the gut can’t survive the composting process for very long and after a few months ‘cold composting’ there are unlikely to be significant numbers left.

If the volume of composting material is above a cubic metre or so, or is in an insulated container such as a Hotbin, the heap may warm up. This happens because every bacterial cell emits a tiny amount of heat as it respires and divides, and in a large enough mass, this heat can build up, making the centre of the heap significantly warmer than ambient temperatures. Above about 40C some thermophilic bacteria find the materials to their liking and they can thrive, raising the temperature to more than 60C sometimes – dependent on the availability of new food, oxygen and the right levels of water. At these temperatures, the enteric bacteria found in faeces will be largely sterilised. A combination of temperature and time in the heap will inactivate all problem organisms, although it would still be advisable to wash hands after handling compost, and avoid getting it into open wounds or eyes.

The recommended time to compost humanure is two years, but in practice many people achieve a good compost in half that time. Another recommendation is to not use the resultant compost for food crops, just in case there are still pathogens around and some fail to be rinsed off the crop in the kitchen. Many humanure composters will use the material under hedges, fruit trees, or other places where it’s unlikely to be a problem.

Compost toilets are very beneficial in many ways. Flush toilets waste VAST quantities of water, usually drinking water quality, and huge amounts of energy are needed to clean this before it gets to our homes, and even more to clean it once it’s left our toilet bowl. Composting humanure retains many of the nutrients we import in our food, and allows us to apply that to our soils, which is great for plants and the wider ecology. Finally, applying compost as a top-dressing and not digging means that carbon will be added to the soil, and soils are known as being huge stores of carbon. So some composters will see their manure and food waste recycling as a way to sequester some carbon every year, and maybe offsetting some of their emissions.
