For the purposes of this group we use the term 'composting' loosely. The reality is that, unless you don't use your loo very often, your solids won't really get a chance to compost down in-situ. The point is have waste products that are easily dealt with and that can either start/continue their composting outside the boat or can be disposed of easily.

The majority of these toilets separate the liquids and solids using a separator.

These toilets can be home-made or bought, with or without built-in fan/stirrer/agitator. Solids start out dry (fertiliser) but can be set aside to compost or disposed of. Urine easily disposed of but can be used as directly fertiliser (watered down 10:1). 

[DIY toilets](diy/) can be made very inexpensively. If you prefer a [commercial toilet](commercial/), there are a number available. See the sections below for more information:
