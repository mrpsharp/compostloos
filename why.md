## 'Conventional' Boat Toilets

To-date, the most common toilets on boats have been:

1. 'Posh' buckets aka Thetford Cassette loos or 'Porta-Potties'. Both have cassettes that fill up with mixed waste and have to be carried to a disposal point. These have limited capacity and combine the wee and poop into a single bucket. This concoction normal ferments and smells very bad. Disposal can only be via elision points due to blockage issues in normal toilets
1. Pump-out toilets are bigger-scale 'posh buckets' where a fixed on-board tank is used in place of a cassette. The tank can only be emptied at approved 'pump-out' stations which are fairly rare on the cut, busy in summer, cost money and impossible to get to sometimes in winter with CaRT repairs or ice.

## Benefits of Urine Separating Compost Loos

* Separated wee and poop don't smell
* Wee can be easily disposed of in loos or over the embankment if you pour in a different place each time. Wee can also be diluted 10:1 and use to fertilise flowers or veggies.
* Poop can be set aside to start composting or added to a compost pile if you have one, or have access to one. In the event that you can't put the solids in a compost pile you are allowed to dispose of it in a normal refuse container as its considered no worse (indeed better) than disposable nappies.
* The compost loo solids container doesn't suddenly fill up and the wee container can be easily emptied so no rush trips to the elsan or pump-out station
* You can purchase fancy loos for about Â£800 or build one for as little as nothing!
* Solids container lasts much longer than a cassette so fewer 'disposals;
* If you use a bag (biodegradable or otherwise) - you can set the solids aside on your roof or deck until its convenient to dispose giving you more options - especially when you aren't near a disposal point or compost pile.
* Humanure fully composted can be used as a general compost on the garden.
