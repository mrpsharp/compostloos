> I got interested in the subject as I was about to leave the temporary moorning I had for my first winter here and sally forth to the world of the towpath. I found I was more concerned about how and where to empty the loo than all the talk of lawless areas, no mooring space and bike thefts! Having discovered that the only option to extend my porta potti capacity was to buy a complete extra loo (and even that probably wouldn’t be enough) I set about reading everything I could find about composting loos – and worked out a simple approach that I could use in addition to my porta potti by way of a trial. After 18 months I’m a total convert, I’m currently on a mooring in Kingsland basin with two elsan points and I still prefer using my composting loo. Firstly, it doesn’t smell, and secondly I don’t have to lug a 20 kilo+ cassette full of slopping sewage through the boat to the elsan. I take 2-3l of liquids to empty every couple of days and I have a 25l bucket weighing around 18kg containing solids and sawdust every 10-12 weeks. The 25l bucket spend 8-10 months composting on the roof or in the engine room. The last one has recently been dug into an island area at the end of the basin (by someone other than me I might say – that is how happy I was that the contents were thoroughly composted) where it is feeding the trees. And finally, I’m not chucking half the contents of my water tank out with the porta pot!
