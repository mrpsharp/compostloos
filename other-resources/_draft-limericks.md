**Language not for the faint-hearted!**  
  
### Colin Ives   
  
There was a young woman called Winkle    
Who would love to sit back for her tinkle  
So she opened the ﬂap  
with her bum at the back  
Now the sawdust's all wet from her sprinkle.  
  
There was once a young lady from Killkenny  
Who was so desperate to spend her a penny  
The urgency was clear  
‘Cos her need was so dear  
And luckily her bottle was empty    
  
### Alan Baxter  
  
There is an old man in Nantucket  
Who shits everyday in a bucket  
He sits down to wee about quarter past three   
He's still there and I'm desp'rate -- oh f***it  
  
### Marie Baker  
  
There was a young man from Dundee  
Who insisted on standing to pee,   
He stood by the po  
And proudly let go  
And it splashed back and soaked all his knee  
  
There was a young lady called Pru  
Who once bought a composting loo.  
She said "It's my goal  
To s**t through the hole  
But it's not very easy to do”.  
  
### Fran Fenton  
  
There was once a Old man and his trusty Kildwick.   
He only needed to empty it when he ﬁlled it.   
He sat back once a day, and enjoyed covering his bum clay.   
in only the ﬁnest sawdust shavings from Wilko-it!  
  
### Lizzy Lisa Bannister  
  
There was an old boater who went to the loo  
But a lavie like this, he hadn't a clue  
Which hole do I use he yelled out loud   
Gongoozlers stopped and formed a crowd  
  
#### Colin variation  
There was an old boater who went to the loo  
But a lavie like this, he hadn't a clue  
Which hole do I use, the front or the back?  
The designer of this is getting the sack  
  
### Tony Smith  
  
Park yer ass whatever you pass,  
as close to the front as you can.  
No need to teach  
Just consider your reach  
And ignore the buzz, it's a fan!  
  
### Melanie Parsons  
  
I met a young man from Crewe  
Who had a new compost loo  
He struggled with shitting  
And peeing when sitting  
And he still hasn't quite got a clue!

A compost loo is a work of art  
But there’s things to learn right from the start  
With the old type of loo, you could ﬂush and go  
With a compost loo this just won’t do  
  
All of your dumps do not go away  
Right in that bucket they will stay  
Same with your wee (It’s much the same)  
In a separate pot that will remain  
  
So a new routine you must adopt  
Old habits you had must now be stopped  
You must pee tot he front, and poo to the back  
All of your solids must now hit the sack…  
  
But don’t be alarmed, it’s a easy matter  
And you’ll be proud as punch, from here ever after!  
  
——  
To pee or not to pee  
Is really not the question  
It’s the direction that you point it in  
Being the ultimate intention  
  
A woman sits to do her thing  
This is the normal pose  
But a man will stand when he does his thing  
And down the hole it goes  
  
Now pay heed, you men who wee  
A good aim is what we’re after  
You must now sit (for pee and shit)  
To avoid a mix disaster!!!

My ﬁrst time on a compost loo,  
  
I thought my aim would be true,  
But my load missed the hole,   
Some went in the bowl,   
And so mixed up my pee and my poo  
——  
If you're like me and live in a van,  
You'll save water wherever you can   
With a composting loo, you separate pee and poo, and for slight smells just turn on the fan

An Ode to bettering your bog.  
  
And so my chums in Kildwick  
Are building compost loos  
At ﬁrst it started slowly   
But now it's ‘followed through’  
  
From basic tubs and boxes  
They started in a tent  
But now they're doing business  
And a unit they must rent.   
  
Their loos are really lovely   
They've developed such a range  
You can even have them glittered   
If you're fancying a change.  
  
A bit of decoupage   
And in shades to suit your mood   
You can sit there really happy  
Whilst you wee or do a poo.  
  
Their colour combos dazzle   
There's one for any taste  
And there's even special baggies  
To help you deal with waste.  
  
They've done tons of research  
Their loos withstand the tests  
They'll make you sing with happiness  
And really impress guests.  
  
So if you're fed up with the elsan   
And the pump out makes you groan  
Contact the folks at Kildwick   
They'll provide you with a throne.

An ode to poo beginnings (Kildwick) …  
  
There was a young man - Colin was his name  
He used to use a cassette loo but thought it was a shame  
He didn't like the elsan points as no one kept them clean  
The stink was overwhelming after someone else had been  
  
He had a word with others they did all agree   
There must be some improvement for removing poo and pee  
He sat down in contemplation  
To formulate a plan  
And came up with a compost loo - the story thus began  
  
He started out quite simply and began to feel his way  
But it seems that others too believed  
cassettes have had their day.  
  
Now their compost loos are super  
They really are the rave  
Their compact loos go anywhere  
And Kildwick's making waves  
  
So we wish you all the best and hope it's really not too crass  
When we toast you and salute you shouting   
'Where's there's muck there's always brass’  
  
——  
  
I'm going to have to stop this now  
As it's straining at my brain   
I'd go outside and sunbathe   
But it's pouring down with rain  
  
I can't get to the sofa  
Or I'd rest up for a while  
But as usual it's full of crap  
All mounting in a pile   
  
I've already done the dishes  
So perhaps I'll make the tea  
The ﬂaming cassettes full again  
So I can't have a pee  
  
So I'll cross me legs whilst cooking  
And wait for George to wake  
I'll be off to veggie boaters group   
To think of what to make…  
  
…Probably a curry  
You know what I am like   
I'd bugger off to Tesco   
But there's a puncture on me bike  
  
I've found an unripe plantain  
lurking by the sink  
So once again it's curry  
Soz not sorry for the stink

It's easy to compost your poo  
Just remember these things you must do  
Men always must sit  
Women perch forward a bit  
No smells, unlike other styles, too.  
—  
We don't like to think that it's waste  
On principles, sound, it is based  
Use sawdust or other  
Carbon content to cover  
And give back to the earth without haste  
—-  
If you need a portable loo  
For camping or offgrid to-do  
Take a basic composter  
It's not an imposter  
It's simple and ethical too  
—-  
You don't to have a main drain  
To live closer to nature again  
A composting bog  
All your friends are agog  
But this throne over others does reign  
—-  
It's easy as easy can be  
To compost your poo and your pee  
Buy a loo ready made  
DIY makes the grade -   
Like the one built by Laurence and me  
—-  
There was a young man who was new  
To using a composting loo  
He tried standing up  
The mucky young pup  
And peed all over his shoe  
——  
The water you use when you ﬂush  
Is expensive and wasteful and such  
Dry closets are best  
Give the planet a rest  
Use the compost on a shrub or a bush.  
——  
If you have a conventional loo  
(Into which you pee and you poo)  
Mind out for your toothbrush  
When you've ﬁnished and you ﬂush  
You'll be cleaning your teeth with the goo  
——  
So you're into this composting caper  
But what do you do with the paper?  
Just chuck it in  
or a separate bin  
or burn in the ﬁre with a taper  
——  
now you've ﬁlled your bottle with wee  
it's fertiliser for free  
  
dilute it a bit  
It's a sure-ﬁre hit  
poured on grass or under a tree  
——  
The poo bucket lasted two weeks  
And some people think we are freaks  
But the saving's immense  
Not just a few pence  
You can hear our jubilant shrieks  
——  
Any man who'll not sit down to pee  
In defence of his mas-cu-lin-a-tee  
Needs to do a re-think  
Or have far less to drink  
Or go behind a nice tree.  
  
Alan Wildman  
  
There was a young lady called Mog  
She had problems when using her bog  
It used to smell foul when emptying her bowel  
And the stink all around was like fog  
  
Then one day she bought a composter  
About four hundred quid it did cost her  
Now there's no smell at all when she answers the call   
The composter - a love we should foster  
  
——  
When you empty your separating loo  
With the proceeds, oh what do you do  
Just tip away the pee, make logs from the poo - and then burn them the whole night through  
——  
As I sit on my composting loo  
Just having a pee and a poo  
I know for "certin" that I ain't "hurtin"  
Planet earth with chemical goo  
——  
Oh today is a wonderful day  
I have "bogged" in a different way  
No more elsan or pump out  
No more awful stink out  
I've discovered the composting loo  
——  
In these days of widespread pollutions  
You can contribute towards the solutions  
When you piddle or poo  
Use a composting loo  
The best way to do your ablutions  
——  
To piddle and poo in a separating loo,   
It's as easy as can be  
Just aim your bum at the bit at the back  
And then aim at the front for your wee  
——  
As I sit upon my composting throne  
The extractor fan makes a comforting drone  
Wee to the front, poo to the back  
  
Composting bogs are the real crack !  
——  
Bogee, oh bogee, I do love thee  
You separate my poo and wee  
You don't smell and you're cheap to run  
Separators are the best bogs under the sun  
——  
No more stinky Elsan nor smelly pump outs too  
I have found my salvation in a nicer, kinder loo  
So whence this liberation, I can hear you say  
It's all because I now bog in the separating way

There was a young lady from Diss,   
Who thought she would just have a piss,   
But she had no control  
And pooed in the hole,   
That silly young lady called Fliss.  
  
Now that silly young lady from Diss,   
Who had proudly thought she'd not miss,   
Gave her face a quick slap,   
She'd forgotten the ﬂap,   
When she turned and was confronted with this.   
——  
There was an old man from the Rio Grande,   
Who thought it his god given right to stand,   
He pee'd with such power,   
He created a shower,   
That covered the walls and the washstand.  
  
This same old man from the great Rio Grande,   
Admitted that this wasnt planned,   
He agreed with a whimper,   
That yes it was now much damper,   
And he'd clean up his mess with his hand.  
  
This reformed old man from the Rio Grande,   
No longer feels that he is unmanned,   
By the need to be sitting,   
Whether peeing or shitting,   
Plus it keeps his dear wife sweet and kind.  
——  
My Compost Loo – an ode.  
  
Are you sitting comfortably, then I will begin,  
For you to still be standing then that will be a sin.  
You might not think it matters if your peeing causes splatters  
Or your aim might be so dire that you miss the loo entire  
But let me tell you,   
and I give you this for free  
You really wouldn’t want to be around me when I’m angry  
  
Now I’ve also been told, if I might make so bold  
That some ladies do not have full sphincter control  
So, if you are not sure what you came in here for  
Please release the ﬂap in case of accidental crap  
  
You do not want to hear, the sound of me squealing  
nor deal with the squishing of the errant ‘little darling’ in the trap  
I can cope with a little bit of wee in the poo  
I’d advise you err to caution, in case of follow through  
Please keep my loo pristine,   
and leave it nice and clean  
As I can be a little vicious   
When I vent   
my spleen.

There was a man called Stan  
Who used to point Percy at the pan  
But now he must sit not just for a s***  
But I know the man Stan can !  
  
Chop Wales  
  
There was a young man called Magoo.  
Who wanted a pee in the loo.  
But for composting wees, he'd need to bend at the knees,  
and plonk his bum on the seat properly too!  
  
Isoult Tibby-Cattistock  
There was a young lady from Looe,  
who sat on her throne for a wee and poo.   
Moving fore and aft,   
to perfect her craft,  
bum back fanny forward should do.
