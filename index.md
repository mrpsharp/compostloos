# Compost toilets for boats and off-grid living

This website is a collection of resources for those using, or thinking of using, separating toilets and a composting system for off-grid living including boats, vans, cabins, camp-sites etc. Or even just wondering what on earth a separating toilet might be! Most of the information on here comes from the [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/compostingloos). For more info see [about](about/).

## What is a compost toilet?

It isn’t really accurate to talk about ‘a composting toilet’ because the toilet is only the collection bit, you still need space to complete the composting process. In the very simplest form of loo, everything goes in one container with lots of sawdust. However, that requires a sizeable compost heap to finish it off and a lot of sawdust so most boaters and van dwellers are using systems that separate liquid and solids. These have a thing to divert the liquid off into a container and a second container for solids to which a good handful of carbon material is added after each use. There are expensive commercial versions and the simplest of DIY systems, built from recycled wood and using found containers. The commercial ones include a fan which dries the contents, shrinking the bulk and starting the composting process. However, a fan isn’t essential – many don’t have one. It doesn’t smell. More information about different types of toilets can be found in the [toilets section](toilets/).

Once the bucket is full the contents need time to compost (assuming a broad varied diet including meat – about a year, less if you are vegetarian or vegan). Some have bankside or garden compost bins, others (including me) compost on the boat. For more information see the [composting section](composting/).bundle

Whilst there is lots to recommend composting loos, it is a different approach and takes a little getting used to. Using a loo with a urine diverter takes a bit of practice in terms of aim and men do need to sit down to wee (sorry about that). And the composting process needs monitoring. For example, one system is based on buckets from a hydroponic grower so they have an airtight lid. Most of the time this is propped open to allow ventilation but every few weeks they are clamped on firmly and the bucket tipped over, rolled around, and left it for a bit so that any moisture that has pooled at the bottom spreads itself more evenly. Then the lid is loosened again – there is a bit of a slight farmyardy whiff at this stage, but compared to the contents of a cassette, it is quite delightful!

Have I mentioned that it doesn’t smell?
